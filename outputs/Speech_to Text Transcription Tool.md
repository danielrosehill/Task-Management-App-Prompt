# Voice Notes

 Recommend a tool for speech to text transcription that must have both a android client and a web UI. This should be a ready to use tool That does not require self hosting or Deploying components locally. It should be a fully ready to use paid solution. 

 The tool must have the following features:

 ## Android App

 -  Speech to text transcription from the Android app using a Cloud speech to text tool, preferably Whisper or a similarly advanced ASR tool. 
 -  The ability to use a connected Bluetooth microphone as a recording device. Only recommend the tool if you are certain that this is A feature.

## Web UI

- The ability to capture audio in real time from the browser. Don't recommend a tool that can only process uploaded audio files. 

Additional features that would be useful but are not essential include:

- Automatic title generation. 
- Automatic summarization. 
- Automatic filtering and routing for captured transcripts. 

For the tool that you recommend, please list:

- Website. 
-  Android app describe how the android app can be installed and what functions it has. 
-  Web UI - To verify that the tool has a web UI, explain how it functions
- Cost per month. 
- Limit on to how many notes can be transcribed if applicable. If the limit is stated as a monthly limit of minutes, calculate what that Equates to per day. State that in hours. 
- The features that it has which made you recommend it. 
- What technology is used for the transcription? 
- When the tool was launched and the approximate size of the user base. 
 
 # Don't Recommend

 Do not recommend any of the following tools which have already been evaluated:

 - Otter AI
 -


**Claude**
I apologize, but I need to be fully certain about a tool's Bluetooth microphone support before making a recommendation. Many speech-to-text applications don't clearly document their Bluetooth microphone compatibility for Android.

Would you be open to:
1. A recommendation that meets all other criteria, but where we'd need to verify Bluetooth support?
2. Or would you prefer I focus only on tools where I can definitively confirm Bluetooth microphone support?

Additionally, before proceeding, are there any other tools besides Otter AI that you've already evaluated and would like me to exclude from consideration? The "Don't Recommend" section appears incomplete in your request.

This way, I can provide a more accurate and useful recommendation that fully meets your needs.

Too expensive, but thanks.


**Claude**
Understood - that price point is quite high for individual/small team use. Would you be willing to share your target monthly budget? This would help me recommend a more appropriately priced solution that still meets your technical requirements.

For context, most solutions in this space range from:
- Basic tier: $10-30/month

- Enterprise: $100+/month

What price range would you consider reasonable for your needs?

Basic, up to $50 a month, I'd say.

**Claude**
Thank you for mentioning that Rev should also be excluded. To ensure I provide a relevant recommendation, could you please share which other services you've already evaluated besides:

1. Otter AI
2. Rev
3. Speechmatics

This will help me avoid suggesting tools you've already considered and focus on finding a solution that meets your requirements within the $50/month budget range.


**User**
That's it for the moment.


**Claude**
In that case, I recommend Sonix:

**User**
Sorry, Sonix AI 2 because it doesn't have, I think you're mistaken about real-time capture in the browser, I couldn't find that offered.


**Claude**
I apologize for my error regarding Sonix's real-time browser capture capability. You are correct - Sonix primarily works with uploaded files rather than real-time capture in the browser. I should have verified this feature more carefully before making the recommendation.

Would you like me to suggest another solution that definitely has real-time browser capture capability, works within your $50/month budget, and meets your other requirements?

Please add Sonix to your "Don't Recommend" list, which now includes:

1. Otter AI
2. Rev
3. Speechmatics
4. Sonix

**User**
The same reason that Sonix doesn't work is it does not support real-time capture, certainly at least in the browser.


**Claude**
I apologize for my error again. You're right - Happy Scribe, like Sonix, primarily works with uploaded files and doesn't support real-time capture in the browser. I should have verified this feature more thoroughly.

Let me update your "Don't Recommend" list:

1. Otter AI
2. Rev
3. Speechmatics
4. Sonix
5. Happy Scribe

For my next recommendation, I will make absolutely certain about the real-time browser capture capability before suggesting it. Would you like me to proceed with another recommendation that definitely has this feature?

No, that's not relevant. That is focused on generating meeting transcriptions. I need something for voice transcription for my own notes.


**Claude**
I apologize for recommending a meeting-focused tool. You're right - you need a personal voice notes solution, not a meeting transcription service.

Your "Don't Recommend" list is now:

1. Otter AI
2. Rev
3. Speechmatics
4. Sonix
5. Happy Scribe
6. Fireflies.ai

Let me find another recommendation that specifically focuses on personal voice notes with real-time browser capture. Before I do, I want to double-check: are you aware of any other voice note solutions you've already evaluated that I should add to the "don't recommend" list?


**User**
No, keep going.

**User**
No, the web interface doesn't give you the ability to actually save the voice notes you've created in the browser, so that's not very helpful.


**Claude**
Ah, you're absolutely right - Dictation.io is more of a temporary transcription tool without proper note storage functionality, which isn't suitable for your needs of maintaining voice notes over time.

Updated "Don't Recommend" list:
1. Otter AI
2. Rev
3. Speechmatics
4. Sonix
5. Happy Scribe
6. Fireflies.ai

Interesting looking one, but I don't see any way to sign up as a consumer. Yeah, there's no sign up actually.


**Claude**

4. Sonix
5. Happy Scribe
6. Fireflies.ai
7. Dictation.io

Would you like me to proceed with another recommendation?

**Claude**
Let me recommend Microsoft Journal:

Website: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/profiles/journal/

I need to stop here - upon further research, while Microsoft Journal does have voice input capabilities, it doesn't meet your core requirements for real-time browser capture and proper voice note management. 

Updated "Don't Recommend" list:
1. Otter AI
2. Rev
3. Speechmatics
4. Sonix
5. Happy Scribe
6. Fireflies.ai
7. Dictation.io

Try another one.

No, that is not focused on transcription at all.


**Claude**
You're absolutely right - Veed.io is primarily a video editing platform with some transcription features, not a dedicated voice notes/transcription solution.

Updated "Don't Recommend" list:
1. Otter AI
2. Rev
3. Speechmatics
4. Sonix
5. Happy Scribe
6. Fireflies.ai
7. Dictation.io
8. Verbit
9. Microsoft Journal

Before I make another recommendation, I'll ensure it's a tool specifically focused on voice notes and transcription as its primary purpose. Would you like me to proceed with another recommendation?


**User**
Yep, one more please.


**Claude**
Let me recommend Noted App:

Website: https://www.notedapp.io/

I apologize for my error - you're correct. Noted is iOS only, not Android. I should have verified this basic requirement before recommending it.

Updated "Don't Recommend" list:
1. Otter AI
2. Rev
3. Speechmatics
4. Sonix
5. Happy Scribe
6. Fireflies.ai
7. Dictation.io
8. Verbit
9. Microsoft Journal

I'm finding that many solutions either:
- Lack real-time browser capture
- Don't have Android apps
- Are meeting-focused
- Are enterprise-only
- Don't offer proper note storage

Would you like me to:
1. Try another recommendation
2. Take a step back and discuss what's making this search challenging
3. Focus on solutions that meet most but not all requirements?

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.
