# Observations

Some notes from the outputs generated against the prompts, both of which are recorded here:

- The output generated by GPT 4o via ChatGPT Is representative of a type of failed output that is very common when trying this type of prompting..In the first output, for example, none of the tools recommended meet the requirements. All fail against validation by not having voice support. An Obsidian fails validation on two counts by neither having voice support nor having web UI. 
-  Output two which was generated by Claude Sonnet 3.5 is much more accurate and on point. It notes correctly that while Notion has voice support on mobile,  there is no built in native voice support integrated into the Web UI (at least at the time of this writing).
