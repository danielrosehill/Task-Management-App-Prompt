Generate a list of suggestions for a task management and note-taking app.

Suggests finished software tools. Do not suggest components or solutions that would require integrations in order to achieve the objective. 

For every recommendation, list the tool, validate its functionalities, and link to its website. 

## Required Features

**Android & Web UI**: Must have a Android and a web UI. Web UI must be a logged on platform and not simply a browser extension. Linux desktop app is not required, but would be advantageous. If you find a tool that has it, note that and which distributions it runs on.

**Voice support:** Must be voice input friendly. On Android, ideally, this means the ability to create tasks quickly using voice either via a shortcut or integration with a digital assistant. These functionalities must also be available on the desktop also (native functionality for voice capture from connected microphone sources/browser without needing to use external tools). Integrated speech-to-text would be a big advantage. 

**Task features:** Gathering tasks, marking tasks as complete. 

**Notes**: Writing, editing, and reading notes. Support for Markdown would be very advantageous. 

**Backups:** Users should be able to back up their notes when required. 

## Useful Additional Features

Additional features that would be nice to have but not essential:

**API:** User Accessible API for integrating with Notes and Taskstore. 

**AI enhancement:** AI enhancements like auto-generating titles and automatically detecting task lists from dictated text would also be very useful. 

## Exclusion criteria:

- Requires self hosting 
- Local only / no way to use online
