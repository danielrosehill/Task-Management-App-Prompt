# Voice-Centric Task Management Tool Prompt - V4 (Revised)

Generate a **single recommendation** for a **ready-to-use** task management and note-taking tool that meets the specified requirements.

Only suggest a fully developed software tool; do not include components, frameworks, or solutions requiring integrations to achieve the desired functionality.

## Spec Requirements

### **Platform Support**
- **Android & Web UI**: The tool must have a native Android app and a fully functional web-based interface (not just a browser extension). 
- **Linux Desktop App (Optional)**: While not mandatory, support for Linux desktop apps is advantageous. If available, specify which Linux distributions are supported.

### **Voice Support**
- Must be voice-input friendly:
  - On Android: Allow quick task creation via voice commands (e.g., shortcuts or integration with digital assistants). A one-click shortcut for creating tasks from voice is ideal.
  - On Desktop: Native voice-capture support for tasks and notes using connected microphones or browsers without relying on external tools.
  - Integrated speech-to-text functionality is highly desirable.

Leveraging Open AI Whisper or a similarly advanced ASR tool is preferred for its generally superior accuracy over browser-based voice dictation.

### **Task Management**
- Ability to create, organize, and mark tasks as complete.




### **Note-Taking**
- Support for writing, editing, and reading notes.
- Markdown support is highly advantageous.

### **Backups**
- Users must be able to back up their notes and tasks when needed.

## **Additional Features (Optional but Useful)**

The following features are not essential but would enhance the user experience:

- **API Access**: A user-accessible API for integrating with external systems like Notes and Taskstore.
- **AI Enhancements**: Features such as:
  - Auto-generating titles for notes or tasks.
  - Automatically detecting task lists from dictated or transcribed text. For example, the user dictates a list of tasks in narrative format and the tool has AI abilities to parse that list and extract the individual tasks from it. 
  -  **LLM Integration**: The ability to generate a note that will be stored in the app by sending text as a prompt to a large language model for completion

## **Exclusion Criteria**

Do not recommend tools that:
1. Require self-hosting or complex setup processes.
2. Are local-only solutions with no online functionality.
