# Manual evaluation notes

02-Jan-25

Accuracy not guaranteed and all observations only as noted on the date of writing. 

## Singularity App

Nice looking tool, but doesn't have native voice support, at least on the web UI. Advantage is that it is intended specifically for parsing chaotic lists, as it says of inbound entries, which aligns very much. Was the type of workflow that I'm trying to support. 

## Notion

Surprisingly also no native voice support on web UI. 

## Todoist

Likewise, no native voice support. One of the outputs suggested there might be an extension, but I couldn't find it in the library. 

## Tick Tick

No native voice support in web UI

## Google Keep

Would be very reluctant to use it, and in any event no native voice support in web UI

## Amplenote

One of the most promising options from the perspective of providing an integrated environment for tasks and notes together, but doesn't have voice support.

## Talk Notes

Nice tool, but this falls down for the opposite reason. While there is native voice support (web and mobile!), there is only voice support IE. You can't create a note texturally!
